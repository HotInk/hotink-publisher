= Settingslogic

Settingslogic is an old library of mine that I decided to go ahead and share with the world. It's nothing crazy or new. Just a simple solution to a simple problem. Settingslogic provides globally accessible settings via an ERB enabled YAML file using a singleton design pattern. It has been great for my apps, maybe you will enjoy it too.

So here is my question to you.....is Settingslogic a great settings solution or the greatest?

== Install and use

Install from rubyforge:

  sudo gem install settingslogic

Install from github:

  sudo gem install binarylogic-settingslogc

Or as a plugin

  script/plugin install git://github.com/binarylogic/settingslogic.git

== Create your settings

By default Settingslogic tries to load config/application.yml. This is just a typical YAML file, notice ERB is allowed.

  # app/config/application.yml
  defaults: &defaults
    cool:
      saweet: nested settings
    neat_setting: 24
    awesome_setting: <%= "Did you know 5 + 5 = " + (5 + 5) + "?" %>
  
  development:
    <<: *defaults
    neat_setting: 800

  test:
    <<: *defaults

  production:
    <<: *defaults

Take note of the environment namespacing. If your framework supports environments this is a good way to support environment specific settings. If you are using this in an area where there are no environment disregard the namespacing. It will work just fine without it.

== Access your settings

  >> RAILS_ENV
  => "development"
  
  >> Settings.cool
  => "#<Settingslogic::Settings ... >"
  
  >> Settings.cool.saweet
  => "nested settings"
  
  >> Settings.neat_setting
  => 800
  
  >> Settings.awesome_setting
  => "Did you know 5 + 5 = 10?"

== Multiple settings

  settings1 = Settings.new(:settings1) # looks for config/settings1.yml
  settings2 = Settings.new("settings2.yaml") # looks for settings2.yml
  settings2 = Settings.new("/abs/path/settings2.yaml") # looks for /abs/path/settings2.yml
  settings3 = Settings.new(:some_setting => "some value")

== Configure

Configuration is optional. See Settingslogic::Config for more details.

  # config/initializers/settingslogic.rb
  Settingslogic::Config.configure do |config|
    config.file_name = :config # will look for config/config.yml
    config.file_name = "config" # will look for config
    config.file_name = "config.yaml" # will look for confg.yaml
    config.file_name = "/absolute/path/config.yml" # will look for /absolute/path/config.yml
  end
